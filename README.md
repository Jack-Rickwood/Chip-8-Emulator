## Requirements
- Requires sdl2 development library which you can get from [here](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).
- Make sure you are building for 64 bit and `./include` is added as an include directory and `./lib` is added as a library directory.
- Make sure SDL2.dll is in the directory with your exe when you run it.
